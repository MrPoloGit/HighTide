# NyuziProcessor Design Decisions

Per-platform notes for `NyuziProcessor` (Jeff Bush) — an open-source GPGPU written in SystemVerilog, with a 4-thread × 16-lane vector ISA. The HighTide port uses 8 vector lanes (halved from upstream 16 to reach a tractable cache-line width) and 2 L2 cache ways (halved from upstream 4) to fit asap7/nangate45/sky130hd floorplans.

FakeRAM macros live at `designs/<platform>/NyuziProcessor/sram/{lef,lib}/` and are wrapped by `designs/src/NyuziProcessor/macros.v`.

## asap7

**Status**: finishing (PR #185, 2026-05-30)

### Configuration

| Knob | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `CORE_UTILIZATION` | 65 | PPA sweep raised 55 → 65; 55 macros are 52% of core, std cells pack the rest. GRT peak 32% on M2 — wide open. |
| `PLACE_DENSITY_LB_ADDON` | 0.22 | Spread cells slightly given the large macro count. |
| `MACRO_PLACE_HALO` | `6 6` | Aggressive (cells are small on asap7). |
| `clk_period` | 3000 ps | Tighter target pushes synth/repair; Fmax = 273.76 MHz (period_min = 3653 ps). WNS reported negative against target — see "Reported WNS" below. |
| `SKIP_CTS_REPAIR_TIMING` | 1 | ODB-1200 workaround — see [CLAUDE.md](../../../CLAUDE.md) bug table. |
| `SKIP_INCREMENTAL_REPAIR` | 1 | ODB-0445 workaround — see CLAUDE.md bug table. |
| `PDN_TCL` | `pdn.tcl` (copy of gemmini's) | Required; default platform PDN was too sparse — see PSM-0069 note below. |
| `PRE_CTS_TCL` | `pre_cts.tcl` | CTS-0105 workaround — see CLAUDE.md bug table. |

### QoR (cached on remote build cache, 2026-05-27)

### Decisions

- **2026-05-25 (PR #185)** — initial close after the long-running port effort failed at PSM-0069 with 18 000+ unconnected filler VDD pins. Root cause: default asap7 platform PDN was too sparse for this design's macro density; PDN-gen removed 983 M2→M5 vias near macro pin obstructions, leaving M1 followpin shapes disconnected. Fix: copied `designs/asap7/gemmini/pdn.tcl` as a denser starting grid (M1/M2 followpins + M5/M6/M7 cross-stripes + macro grids).

- **2026-05-27 (PR #185, second commit)** — 3-step disciplined PPA sweep from the post-PDN-fix baseline:

  | iter | util | SDC (ps) | Fmax (MHz) | core (µm²) | DRC/PSM/IR |
  |---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
  | baseline | 55 | 3800 | 215.67 | 1383 k | 0 / 0 / 0 |
  | iter 1 | 65 | 3800 | 241.41 | 1170 k | 0 / 0 / 0 |
  | **iter 2 (landed)** | **65** | **3000** | **273.76** | **1170 k** | **0 / 0 / 0** |
  | iter 3 abort | 65 | 2500 | — | — | host died mid-build |

  Net vs baseline: **+27% Fmax, −15% area**, all checks clean.

  - **Util 55 → 65**: at baseline, std-cell utilization in the available (non-macro) space was only 7.9% — massive packing headroom. Die shrunk without hitting routing or congestion limits. Macros are now 52% of core; that's the floor without repacking the macros themselves.
  - **SDC 3800 → 3000 ps**: looser 3800 ps targets left synth/repair_timing under-motivated; tightening pushed both to pick faster cells and to optimize the wire-bound L2-cache critical path (`sram_l2_data → l2_response[307]`) harder.

- **2026-05-27** — at util 65 the denser placement exposed **ODB-0445** in post-GRT `repair_timing` (`[CRITICAL] No undo_updateField support for type dbTechNonDefaultRule`). The resizer's `Journal::undo` can't unroll changes to non-default routing rules made during repair, so the slack-spiral retry on a single endpoint crashes out. Same workaround family as snitch_cluster/litedram: `SKIP_INCREMENTAL_REPAIR = 1`. Detailed-route hold-repair still runs and DRC stays clean. Documented in CLAUDE.md's bug-workaround table.

### Reported WNS vs achievable Fmax

The flow reports WNS = −653 ps at the 3000 ps target. That's not a real timing failure: it's the gap between the SDC target and the design's achievable period (3653 ps). Setting SDC to 3653 ps would zero the WNS but synth would slack off, increasing the period — a known ORFS pitfall (the [[#sdc-tightness-coupling]] note below). The reported `period_min`/`fmax` from `report_clock_min_period` are the truth: 273.76 MHz.

### Known issues / open questions

- **CTS-0105 false skip** — yosys hierarchical synthesis output port buffers arrive in ODB with `dbSourceType::TIMING`; `PRE_CTS_TCL` resets them to `NETLIST` before CTS runs ([OpenROAD #10177](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/issues/10177)).
- **ODB-1200** in CTS repair_timing — the gemmini-style targeted fix (drop `split_load` from `SETUP_MOVE_SEQUENCE`) didn't clear it for this design; escalated to `SKIP_CTS_REPAIR_TIMING = 1` ([HighTide #75](https://github.com/VLSIDA/HighTide/issues/75)).
- **ODB-0445** in post-GRT repair_timing — only surfaces at util ≥ 65 here; no upstream issue filed yet.

- None active. Same CTS-0105 workaround applies (yosys-hierarchical port-buffer ODB metadata).
